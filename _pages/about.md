I am Lexiao Lai 赖乐潇, an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php) at the University of Hong Kong. My research is in nonconvex optimization, applied semialgebraic geometry, and data science. I received my Ph.D. degree from Columbia University.

**Prospective Students:** I am actively looking for a self-motivated Ph.D. student starting in *Fall 2026*, who is interested in the theory of optimization and/or data science. Ideal candidates will have a solid background in mathematics, with proficiency in programming being highly desirable. If you are interested in working with me, please email me your CV and transcripts.
